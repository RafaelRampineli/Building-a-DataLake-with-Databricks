# Building a Data Pipeline with Delta Lake, Spark, and Databricks
This project demonstrates how to build a robust and scalable data pipeline using Delta Lake, Apache Spark, and Databricks. The pipeline covers real-world scenarios, including data ingestion, schema handling, upserts (merge operations), and SQL-based transformations, all while leveraging Delta Lake's ACID guarantees.

## Project Features
- Data Ingestion:

Import CSV files into the Databricks File System (DBFS).
Convert CSV files into Delta Lake tables for structured data storage.

- Delta Lake Operations:

Handle ACID transactions for consistency and reliability.
Perform upserts (merge operations) to manage updates and new records seamlessly.

- SQL-Based Transformations:

Use SQL queries to join and analyze data stored in Delta tables.
Extract meaningful insights by combining data across multiple sources.

- Performance Optimization:

Leverage Delta Lake's efficient storage and metadata management to enhance query performance.

## Technologies Used
Apache Spark: Distributed data processing engine.
Delta Lake: Open-source storage layer with ACID transactions.
Databricks: Unified platform for big data and AI.
Python: Programming language for the ETL and data transformation logic.

## Pipeline Workflow

- Environment Setup:
Create a cluster in Databricks.
Upload CSV files to ```dbfs:/FileStore/tables/datalake/csv.```

- Data Processing:
Convert CSV files into Delta tables.
Perform upserts to update or add new data.
Create temporary views for SQL-based analysis.

- Data Transformation:
Write SQL queries to join data from multiple Delta tables.
Save transformed data to a new Delta table.

- Query and Analyze:
Perform targeted queries on transformed data for business insights.

- Cleanup:
Remove temporary and intermediate data when done.

## Getting Started

- Prerequisites:
Databricks workspace with an active cluster.
Basic understanding of Apache Spark and Delta Lake.
Sample CSV files for testing (ensure they match the schema used in the project).

- Setup Instructions:

## Clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delta-lake-pipeline.git
cd delta-lake-pipeline
```

## Upload the provided CSV files to Databricks:
Navigate to Data > Create Table > Upload File.
Select ```dbfs:/FileStore/tables/datalake/csv``` as the target directory.
Run the provided notebook in Databricks to execute the pipeline.
